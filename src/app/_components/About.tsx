          Hi, I'm Mohammad Mehdizade, a Front-End Developer with nearly two years
          of experience in creating responsive, user-focused web applications. I
          specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap, Tailwind, and
          TypeScript. My approach to development revolves around delivering
          seamless user experiences, ensuring responsive design across devices,
          and writing clean, maintainable code that is efficient and scalable.
          When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me enjoying my favorite hobbies:
          reading books, watching movies, and exploring new music.
